## 1. Project Title / Headline

**Sales Vision – Market & Profitability Insights Dashboard**
An interactive sales analytics dashboard built using SQL and Power BI to provide a clear, data-driven view of revenue, profitability, customer performance, and market trends.

---

## 2. Short Description / Purpose

Sales Vision is a comprehensive business intelligence dashboard designed to help stakeholders monitor sales performance, identify profit optimization opportunities, and understand customer and market dynamics. It transforms raw transactional data into actionable insights for faster and smarter decision-making.

---

## 3. Tech Stack

The dashboard was built using the following tools and technologies:

* 📊 **Power BI Desktop** – Interactive data visualization and reporting
* 📂 **Power Query** – Data extraction, cleaning, and transformation
* 🧠 **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)** – Calculated KPIs, profit metrics, and dynamic filtering
* 🛢️ **MySQL** – Backend database for storing and querying transactional data
* 🧩 **Data Modeling** – Star-schema relationships between fact and dimension tables
* 📁 **File Formats** – `.pbix` for development and `.png` for dashboard previews

---

## 4. Data Source

**Source:** https://codebasics.io/resources/sales-insights-data-analysis-project

The dataset contains multi-year transactional sales data across customers, products, and markets. It is structured to simulate real-world business operations and supports revenue, profitability, and trend analysis.

---

## 5. Data Structure

The data follows a **star-schema model** optimized for analytics and reporting.

**Fact Table**

* `transactions`

**Dimension Tables**

* `customers`
* `products`
* `markets`
* `date`

Relationships are established between the transactions table and each dimension table using respective keys.

---

## 6. ETL Process Highlights

### • Extract

* Imported database dump (`db_dump.sql`) into MySQL
* Queried data from transactions, customers, and date tables

### • Transform

* Cleaned currency inconsistencies (INR / USD)
* Normalized USD values into INR using a fixed conversion rate
* Created calculated columns and measures for revenue, profit, margins, and contributions

**Currency Normalization Logic (Power Query):**

```powerquery
= Table.AddColumn(
    #"Filtered Rows",
    "norm_amount",
    each if [currency] = "USD" or [currency] = "USD#(cr)"
    then [sales_amount] * 75
    else [sales_amount],
    type any
)
```

### • Load

* Loaded transformed data into Power BI
* Established relationships between fact and dimension tables
